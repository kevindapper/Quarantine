# Quarantine

This is just some reference html for changing background color that we could use. It is a little laggy on user inputs so that may need to be changed.
I used bootstrap to creat the table and just my own CSS classes to change the background color. Mess around with it to make it look better and work better.
Other then that this also has the `index.js` file that we use to launch the scratch.io information for Node. If you want something to run on the server that has
multi-user functionality I think we should put it in that file so it will run properly. Other then that have fun messing with this code! :D
